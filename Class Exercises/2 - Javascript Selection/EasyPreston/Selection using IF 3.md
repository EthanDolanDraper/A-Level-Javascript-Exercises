## Task 1

The airline **easyPreston** flies to the following destinations with the corresponding ticket prices:

- **Berlin**
- **Madrid**
- **Paris**
- **Rome**

Passengers are charged an additional £20.00 if they wish to check in a suitcase.

Set up and test the program described below. You will need to deduce the names to be used for the text boxes, labels, and command buttons. Note how the combo box has been used.

## Task 2

A-level Computing has four modules. The modules and their marks are listed below:

- **COMP1** – 120
- **COMP2** – 80
- **COMP3** – 80
- **COMP4** – 120

The A2 grade is calculated from the total of all four marks a candidate has been awarded. The grade boundaries are listed below:

| Grade | Percentage         |
|-------|--------------------|
| A     | 80% or greater      |
| B     | 70% or greater      |
| C     | 60% or greater      |
| D     | 50% or greater      |
| E     | 40% or greater      |
| U     | Less than 40%       |

An **A*** is awarded to candidates who achieve an A grade and 90% or more in the A2 modules (COMP3 and COMP4).

Write a program that assigns a grade for A-Level Computing.

## Task 3

The National Certificate in Hang Gliding is awarded as either a **Pass** or **Distinction**. Candidates take two exams: **Theory** and **Practical**. 

- A candidate obtains a **Pass** when their mark for each exam exceeds 50%.
- A **Distinction** is awarded when a candidate satisfies the Pass criteria and their average mark over the two exams exceeds 70%.

Write a program to award the grade using the marks from the two papers.
