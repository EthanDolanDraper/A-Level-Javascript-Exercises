# Times Tables Generator

Create a program with two command buttons that handles times tables:

1. First button should display the 8 Times Table
2. Second button should:
   - Accept a number between 1 and 10 from the user
   - Display that Times Table

## Requirements:
- Create two buttons with clear labels
- Validate that the user input is between 1 and 10
- Display the times tables in a clear, readable format
- Use a for loop to generate the times tables

## Expected Output Format:
```
8 x 1 = 8
8 x 2 = 16
8 x 3 = 24
...etc
```

## Tips:
- Consider using an input field for the user to enter their chosen number
- Remember to convert string input to a number
- Add validation to ensure the input is valid before generating the table
