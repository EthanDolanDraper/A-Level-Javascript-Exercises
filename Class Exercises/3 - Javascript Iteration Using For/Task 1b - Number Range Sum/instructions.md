# Number Range Sum Calculator

Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers between two given integers (inclusive).

## Requirements:
1. Accept two integer inputs from the user
2. Calculate the sum of all numbers between these two numbers (including the input numbers)
3. Display the calculation and the final result

## Example:
If the user enters 4 and 12, the program should:
1. Calculate: 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12
2. Show the calculation: "4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 12 = 78"

## Tips:
- Validate that the first number is less than the second number
- Use a for loop to add up the numbers
- Consider displaying both the calculation process and the final result
- Add error handling for invalid inputs
